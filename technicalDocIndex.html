        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
          example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
          and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its
          functions.</p>
        <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a
          webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading,
          link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you
          define.</p>

      <article>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements,
          which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
          certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can
          make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="bullet"><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
            wrapped in
            opening and
            closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where
            the paragraph begins.</li>
          <li id="bullet"><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes
            a forward
            slash before the
            element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a
            closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
          <li id="bullet"><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just
            text.</li>
          <li id="bullet"><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together
            comprise the
            element.</li>

        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
          Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to
          give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same
          class value) with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.</p>
        <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="number">A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has
            one or more attributes).</li>

        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat
          is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt element, which means that the word is to be
          strongly emphasized: The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside
          one another.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
           &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gtvery&lt;/strong&gt grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <article>
        <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the &lt;img&gt element that we already have
          in our HTML page:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>

          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt; tag and no inner content. This is because
          an
          image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the
          place it appears.

            </code>
          </pre>
        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </strong> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when
            HTML was young
            (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to
            be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these
            days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's
            all you need to know for now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; </strong> — the <strong> &lt;html&gt </strong> element. This element
            wraps all the content
            on the entire page and is
            sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of
            the document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; </strong> — the <strong> &lt;head&gt </strong> element. This element acts
            as a
            container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that
            isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page
            description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set
            declarations, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt; </strong> — This element sets the character set your document should
            use to UTF-8 which
            includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any
            textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems
            later on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt; </strong> — This viewport element
            ensures the page renders
            at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then
            shrinking them down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; </strong> — <strong> the &lt;title&gt; </strong> element. This sets the
            title of
            your page, which is the title that
            appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you
            bookmark/favorite it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; </strong> — the <strong> &lt;body&gt; </strong> element. This contains
            all the
            content that you want to show to
            web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or
            whatever else.

        <p>Cascading Style Sheets — or CSS — is the first technology you should start learning after HTML. While HTML is
          used to define the structure and semantics of your content, CSS is used to style it and lay it out. For
          example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple
          columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to
          get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain
          location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>

      <article>
        <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet
          language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph
          text, setting the color to red:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            p { <hr>
              color: red; <hr>
            }

    <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_a_CSS_ruleset">
      <header>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</header>
      <article>
        <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="css_code_example" />
        <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="number"><strong>Selector</strong> -- This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, &lt;p&gt elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
          <li id="number"><strong>Declaration</strong> -- This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
          <li id="number"><strong>Properties</strong> -- These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the &lt;p&gt elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
          <li id="number"><strong>Property value</strong> -- To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="bullet">Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({}) </li>
          <li id="bullet">Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
          <li id="bullet">Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
          <code>
            p { <hr>
              color: red; <hr>
              width: 500px; <hr>
              border: 1px solid black; <hr>
              }

    <section class="main-section" id="Selecting_Multiple_Elements">
      <header>Selecting Multiple Elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors
          by commas. For example:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            p, <hr>
            li, <hr>
            h1 { <hr>
              color: red; <hr>
              width: 500px; <hr>
              border: 1px solid black; <hr>
              }
